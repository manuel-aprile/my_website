I obtained my bachelor in mathematics in 2013 from University of Catania, Italy, with a thesis on algorithms to construct magic squares. I was supervised by  <a href="http://www.dmi.unict.it/nicosia/">Giuseppe Nicosia</a>. I then moved to Oxford, UK to obtain my master's degree in mathematics and the foundation of computer science in 2014. My master's thesis was about applying constructive versions of Lovasz Local Lemma to non-repetitive graph coloring, and was supervised by <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/colin.mcdiarmid"> Colin McDiarmid </a>. 
I undertook my PhD studies within the DISOPT group at EPFL, Switzerland, and I obtained the PhD title in 2018. My PhD thesis (which you can read <a href="download thesis"> here </a>) summarises my work on 2-level polytopes, in particular with respect to their combinatorial structure and extension complexity, and was supervised by <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disopt/page-10520-en-html/page-31595-en-html/eisenbrand/"> Friedrich Eisenbrand </a> and <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~yf2414/index.html"> Yuri Faenza</a>.

Since 2019, I am a post-doctoral researcher in the group of <a href="http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~sfiorini/"> Samuel Fiorini</a>.
